## How To Use
At the moment, the only functionality is through the back-end, as the front-end has not yet been built out.  However, when the program is complete, you will have multiple options.

You have the ability to find all the countries in the database (db), all the countries you have visited, and all the countries you want to visit.

You can search the database by country name or by its id.

You can replace a country with a different country, or you can delete the country entirely.
